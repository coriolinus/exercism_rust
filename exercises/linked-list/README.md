# Linked List

# Doubly Linked List using `unsafe {}`

Write a doubly linked list and a cursor to traverse it, using unsafe Rust.

The doubly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science,
often used in the implementation of other data structures. They're
pervasive in functional programming languages, such as Clojure, Erlang,
or Haskell, but far less common in imperative languages such as Ruby or
Python.

Each node in a doubly linked list contains data and pointers to the next
and previous node, if they exist.

New nodes can be efficiently added at any point in the list, if one already has
a reference to the position. Likewise, all elements
from another list can be inserted at any point in constant time.

In Rust, linked lists are very rarely used, but occasionally they trip up
newcomers, when they try implementing one. Often, they find it unexpectedly
difficult to work with the yet unfamiliar borrow checker.

# Hints

* A doubly linked does not have a clear ownership hierarchy, which is why it requires either the use
  of unsafe or abstractions for shared ownership like `Rc`. The latter has some overhead that is unnecessary
  for this case.

* Refer to the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) for details on how to use `unsafe {}` correctly.
  Remember, the goal of unsafe Rust is to write safe code in cases where the compiler can't help us
  guarantee correctness. It must not be possible for a user to cause memory unsafety of any kind using
  only the safe interfaces we expose.

* Several functions require similar behaviour in different directions (left or right, start or end). Try not to duplicate
  shared code paths.


## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test. 

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
